                The slow man studies the principle carefully, dwelling on all its aspects.
                A quick person draws many conclusions, but rarely deeply understands his words.
                Anyone who runs through the forest, trying to collect more nuts or mushrooms,
                will not collect many of them. The one who does not fuss will collect more.
                He who wants a lot will receive little,
                but he who is ready to be content with little will receive a lot.

                Nothing contributes to success more than constant, daily training.
                The brilliant Russian pianist A.G. Rubinstein said that if he does not sit down at the instrument
                for one day, he himself notices that his playing has become worse.
                Two days - family and friends are already noticing. Three - everyone sees.
                This is true in any field of activity. Unfortunately, it often happens like this:
                a person caught fire and started training.
                And a week later I went to bed late and could not wake up early.
                Let me think, I will miss one day, no big deal. Then he skips the second day, the third.
                And the start turns out to be on the line again.
